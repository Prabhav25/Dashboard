# Live Link: [Dashboard](https://dashboard-psi-ten-36.vercel.app/).

## Description:  A customizable dashboard lets users add, remove, and manage widgets within categories. Users can easily create widgets with a name and content, organise them under sections, and search across all widgets.

## To Do:
### 1. Create a JSON to build this dashboard/widget dynamically. JSON should contain categories, and each category can contain multiple widgets.
### 2. Users should be able to dynamically add a widget and remove a widget from a section/ category. eg, CSPM Executive dashboard is a category.
### 3. For an individual widget, for assignment purposes, we can just put random text.
### 4. Once the user clicks on +Add Widget, users should be able to add the Widget name, widget text, and it should be added to that category.
### 5. On each widget, we can have a cross icon to remove it from a category, or users can go tothe  add category section and uncheck fromthe  category list
### 6. Users should be able to search a list of all the widgets.

## Technologies used: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux

## Achieved:
### 1. Created a dashboard displaying categories and widgets inside each category.
### 2. The user can search for any widget using the search bar.
### 3. The user can add a widget using the Add widget option for any category and can add a name and text for the widget created.
### 4. The user can delete any widget using the cross mark on each widget.
